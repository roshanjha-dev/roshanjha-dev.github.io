***Research Scholar, Computer Science, IIT Bombay***

Currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) at IIT Bombay under the supervision of [Prof. Devashish Gosain](https://www.devashishgosain.com/). My research is focused on Privacy and Network Security. Prior to this, I completed my Master of Technology (MTech) from IIT Bhilai under the guidance of [Prof. Dhiman Saha](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php?pid=dhiman) and [Prof. Santosh Biswas](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php?pid=santosh) and my BTech from JECRC (RTU Kota). I also have industry experience as a Software Engineer at [Persistent Systems Ltd.](https://www.persistent.com/), where I strengthened my software development and engineering skills.

As a dedicated student and developer, I am deeply engaged in the field of Computer Science. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages including C, C++, Java, Android, and Python, with a strong foundation in competitive coding, especially in Java. I am consistently driven by a desire to explore emerging technologies and deepen my understanding of new programming paradigms and tools.

Along with software development, Iâ€™m interested in research that improves the security and performance of systems, especially in cybersecurity, networking, and operating systems. Outside of work, I like playing badminton, gaming, and sharing knowledge in both tech and non-tech areas.
