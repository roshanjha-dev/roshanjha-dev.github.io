Research Scholar, Computer Science, IIT Bombay

I am Roshan, currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) at IIT Bombay under the supervision of [Prof. Devashish Gosain](https://www.devashishgosain.com/). My research is focused on Privacy and Network Security. Prior to this, I completed my Master of Technology (MTech) from IIT Bhilai under the guidance of [Prof. Dhiman Saha](http://dhimans.in/) and [Prof. Santosh Biswas](https://www.iitbhilai.ac.in/index.php?pid=santosh). I also bring industry experience from my tenure as a Software Engineer at [Persistent Systems Ltd.](https://www.persistent.com/), where I honed my skills in software development and engineering practices.

As a dedicated student and developer, I am deeply engaged in the field of Computer Science. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages including C, C++, Java, Android, and Python, with a strong foundation in competitive coding, especially in Java. I am consistently driven by a desire to explore emerging technologies and deepen my understanding of new programming paradigms and tools.

In addition to software development, I have a keen interest in hardware engineering, particularly in assessing the security of hardware systems. My research aims to uncover vulnerabilities and enhance robustness in cybersecurity, systems, and networking. I am particularly enthusiastic in Android development. Outside the academic and research domains, I enjoy playing badminton, computer gaming, and engaging with others to exchange knowledge and provide support in a range of technical and non-technical areas.
